This is a repository of our Bingo project.

The purpose of this project was to create a Bingo game which would mirror a regular game. The generation of random numbers is performed through the PL of the system, while the interactivity with the user and visual aspects created through software. 

The "PYNQ" folder contains all the files required to get the design up and running easily - simply copy the contents to a folder on your PYNQ-Z2 board's SD card. Within this folder there is a "Sounds" folder which contains all the audio files required and also an "Overlays" folder which contains our hardware IPs.

The "RNG" folder contains both the final RNG design and previous versions. The final system generator design can be found in "RNG_LFSR_FINAL".
