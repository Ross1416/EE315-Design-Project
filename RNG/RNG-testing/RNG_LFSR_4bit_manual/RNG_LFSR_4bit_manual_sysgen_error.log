Error 0001:

Reported by:
  'RNG_LFSR_4bit_manual/Logical'
  'RNG_LFSR_4bit_manual/Register'
  'RNG_LFSR_4bit_manual/Register1'
  'RNG_LFSR_4bit_manual/Register2'
  'RNG_LFSR_4bit_manual/Register3'

Details:
Rates and types converged for the feedback path through these
blocks. However, the solution contains unknowns.  Could not
establish rates for the blocks listed at the end of this message.

You may need to add an "Assert" block to instruct the system how
to resolve rates and types.

In the debugging of this problem, you may find it helpful to have
the sample rates displayed on the Simulink diagram. This will
happen if you open the System Generator block's dialog box, set
its "Block Icon Display" control to "Sample Rates", and then
update the diagram.

You may need to add an "Assert" block to instruct the system how

Debugging can also be assisted by turning on the display of
types, either by setting the Block Display control on the System
Generator block or by turning on Simulink's "Format -> Signal
Display -> Port Data Type" control.
